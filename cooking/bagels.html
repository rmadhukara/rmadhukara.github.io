        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Top with (optional)</h4>

      <h2>procedure.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. When adding the
          yeast, try to avoid contact with the salt since salt kills yeast.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a well in the middle of the mixture, and start adding the water
          in 1/2 cup increments. Mix well until a smooth dough forms. If it is
          too dry, add 1 tablespoon of warm water at a time as needed. If it is
          too wet, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flour a countertop or large cutting board, and knead the dough for 10
          minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wet the inside of a clean large non-metal bowl with water, place the
          dough inside, and turn to coat until the outside is moist. Cover with
          a damp dish towel and set it to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or
          until it has doubled in size. Once risen, punch down the dough and set
          it aside for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Remove the
          dough from the bowl, and divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each
          dough piece into a ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coat your finger in flour, then press into the center of ball to form
          a ring. Stretch the dough balls into a rings about â…“ the diameter of
          the bagel, then place onto the baking sheet. Cover with a damp towel
          and let it sit for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 425ËšF, and bring a large pot of water to a boil.
          Get your seasonings and almond milk ready as you will need that next.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the water has boiled, reduce the heat to medium, and use a
          slotted spoon to lower as many bagels that fit comfortably into the
          water. Once they to float to the top (a couple seconds), boil for 2
          minutes, flip, then boil for another 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all the bagels have boiled, transfer them to your lined baking
          sheet. Brush the dough with almond milk, and sprinkle with your
          seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the bagels 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven
          and cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes. Store in an air tight
          container for 4-5 days.

      <h2>notes.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Makes eight bagels. Feel free to cut the recipe in half.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like eating with either vegan or non-vegan store bought cream
          cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite bagel sandwich is some arugula (or lettuce), avocado,
          green onions, pepper, and cream cheese.
        </li>
