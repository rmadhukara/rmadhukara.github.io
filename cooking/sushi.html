    <hr />

    <div class="good">
      <h2>ingredients.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups short-grain Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="good">
      <h2>procedure.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rinse rice under running water until water runs clear. This will take
          about 2 to 5 minutes. Then let rice dry for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the rice and water to the Instant Pot and use the rice setting
          (low pressure for 12 minutes). Once the cook time is complete, allow
          the pressure to naturally release. This will take about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar, and
          salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the rice to a glass dish. Then, using a wooden/bamboo spoon,
          add vinegar mixture and gently mix well to combine. It is important to
          be very gentle here -- we want to make sure not to crush any of the
          grains of rice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let cool and then use for sushi!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>notes.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Makes enough rice to make enough sushi rolls to comfortably feed a
          family of 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          I recommend buying a bamboo sushi making set. The rice vinegar can
          react with metals so it is very important that the rice be stored in a
          glass bowl and only handled with non-metal utensils.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like putting avocado, cucumber, bell pepper, and carrot in my rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          For dipping sauces I like using soy sauce and sriracha.
        </li>
