    <h1 style="text-align: center;">pizza dough.</h1>

    <hr />

    <div class="good">
      <h2>ingredients.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="good">
      <h2>procedure.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar and instant yeast. Try
          not to put instant yeast on top of salt as salt kills yeast.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a well in the middle of the mixture and add the olive oil and
          warm water slowly. Recommend adding 1/4 cups of water at a time to
          make sure that the dough does not become too wet. Additionally, make
          sure to incorporate oil with water to make sure no "oil patches"
          develop in the dough. (Not a big deal if this happens as this can be
          fixed with kneading.)
        </li>
        <li>Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
        <li>
          Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean
          work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft,
          smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside,
          turning to coat with the oil. Cover with wet towel. Let rise for at
          least an hour, or up to 24 hours. (I like to prepare the dough in the
          morning or early afternoon if I'm making pizza for dinner.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work
          surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 2 equal
          portions and shape into rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest
          for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any
          other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 500ËšF or as high as your oven will go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stretch and press the dough into a thin round on a parchment lined
          baking sheet. Make the dough thinner than you think it should be, as
          it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice and slide into the oven.
          Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>notes.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Makes two medium pizzas -- good for my family of 4 for dinner. Feel
          free to double the recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the sauce I like using a store bought pesto, but you can use any
          sauce you want.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like pairing our sauce with a combination of feta and mozarella
          cheese (not vegan).
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite vegetables to top with are bell pepper, onions,
          artichokes, olives, and some jalapenos. I've experimented with both
          fresh and jarred jalapenos; I prefer jarred since the flavor is more
          subtle.
        </li>
      </ul>
